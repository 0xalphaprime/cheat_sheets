_"The mind is restless, Krishna, impetuous, self-willed, hard to train: to master the mind seems as difficult as to master the mighty winds."_

My treasure map to previous discovery.

# Introduction to Computer Science

Towards the end of my post-grad degree (Sep. 2021), we received an introduction to the underlying concepts behind blockchain ledgers. Instantly, I had to scratch the itch. The potential of smart-contracts has held my attention since.

Through this exploration I have found a true passion with networks, computing, & programming.

Included are some of the resources that have guided me, along with some early projects and areas of my exploraion.

_"Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming."_

I greatlt appreciate this course. It was extremly helpful for me to outline the broad components and themes, allowing me to begin to form a mental construct to build on.

# Project 1 - Liftoff - Running A Rocketpool Node

### Hardware

[Patrick Collins - Setting Up NUC for ETH Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDADwYwzPAo&t=18s)

Patrick does a great overview in this video, with a NUC setup. Linux OS USB burn and install. This is popular setup among home stakers, and a much more cost effective option for this particular project.

This was my first computer build, so I went with a bit more than was required.

Be **certain of compatibility across all component parts**. ~~One~~ Two costly mistakes were made. Each cost me hours. Learn from them, this time!

_"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."_

(1) I bought server grade RAM, which was not compatible with my consumer mother board
(2) Originally, I bought a more powerful GPU. However, for this project I was going to be running ubuntu server 20.04 - which did not have compatibility plug-n-play
