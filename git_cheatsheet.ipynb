    "As you probably know, Git is a distributed version control system. Most operations are done locally. To communicate with the outside world, Git uses what are called \"remotes\". These are repositories other than the one on your local disk (`master`) which you can `push` your changes into (so that other people can see them) or `pull` from (so that you can get others changes). The command `git remote add origin git@github.com:peter/first_app.git` creates a new remote called `origin` located at `git@github.com:xxx/yyy.git`. Once you do this, in your push commands, you can push to origin instead of typing out the whole URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is git `push origin master`?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a command that says \"`push` the `commits` in the local `branch` named `master` to the `remote` named `origin`\". Once this is executed, all the stuff that you last synchronised with origin will be sent to the remote repository and other people will be able to see them there.\n",
