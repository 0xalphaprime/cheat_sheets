    "### __Docker Concepts__\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, share, and run applications with containers. The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerisation. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containerisation is increasingly popular because containers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerised.\n",
    "- Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel, making them much more efficient in terms of system resources than virtual machines.\n",
    "- Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.\n",
    "- Loosely coupled: Containers are highly self sufficient and encapsulated, allowing you to replace or upgrade one without disrupting others.\n",
    "- Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas across a datacenter.\n",
    "- Secure: Containers apply aggressive constraints and isolations to processes without any configuration required on the part of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Containers & Virtual Machines__\n",
    "\n",
    "A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, a __virtual machine (VM)__ runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs incur a lot of overhead beyond what is being consumed by your application logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image - containers vs VMs](/Users/hiro0x/Documents/alphaprime/masterQuest/screenshots/containers-v-vms.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual Machines are slow and take a lot of time to boot.\n",
    "- Containers are fast and boots quickly as it uses host operating system and shares the relevant libraries.\n",
    "- Containers do not waste or block host resources unlike virtual machines.\n",
    "- Containers have isolated libraries and binaries specific to the application they are running.\n",
    "- Containers are handled by Containerisation engine.\n",
    "- Docker is one of the containerisation platforms which can be used to create and run containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __How does Docker Work?__\n",
    "\n",
    " Docker has a docker engine, which is the heart of Docker system. It is a client-server application. It has three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A __server__ which is a type of long-running process called a __daemon process__.\n",
    "- A __client__ which is __Docker CLI( Command Line Interface)__, and\n",
    "- A __REST API__ which is used to communicate between the client( Docker CLI ) and the server ( Docker Daemon )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Docker daemon receives the command from the client and manages Docker *objects*, such as __images__, __containers__, __networks__, and __volumes__. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Image - Docker Client Server Diagram](/Users/hiro0x/Documents/alphaprime/masterQuest/screenshots/docker-client-server.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Linux__ - Linux based docker can only run Linux based containers\n",
    "- __Windows__ - comes stock with both a Windows & Linux kernal, and can run both\n",
